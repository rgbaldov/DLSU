## Main Objective:
To develop a drone-based system with depth cameras and computer vision for automated aircraft surface damage assessment, integrated with digital twin technology for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance

## Key Features:
- **Drone-Based Inspection:** Autonomous flights for fast and efficient aircraft surface coverage.  
- **Depth Cameras:** High-resolution 3D imaging for accurate damage detection and sizing.  
- **Computer Vision:** Automated identification of dents, cracks, scratches, and corrosion.  
- **Digital Twin:** Virtual aircraft model updated with real-time inspection data.  
- **Reporting:** Maintenance reports to support decision-making and compliance.  

## Scope and Limitations:
### Scope  
- Develop a drone-based aircraft inspection system using depth cameras, computer vision, and digital twin technology for surface damage detection.  
- Focus on Airbus A320 aircraft as the baseline model for testing and validation.  
- Limit inspections to external surfaces (fuselage and wings) for detecting dents, cracks, corrosion, and visible damage.  
- Design and test a prototype system consisting of a drone platform, camera sensors, and software algorithms for image capture, damage detection, and 3D visualization.  
- Explore integration with digital twin models for aircraft condition monitoring and provide basic reporting for quality control.  

### Limitations  
- System testing restricted to Airbus A320 models; other aircraft types not included.  
- Inspections limited to external surfaces only; no internal components or avionics covered.  
- Real-world implementation with Cebu Pacific subject to regulatory approval; airport testing may be restricted.  
- Prototype focused on proof-of-concept accuracy and reliability, not full-scale commercial deployment.  
- Environmental factors (e.g., extreme weather, poor lighting, crowded conditions) excluded from initial testing.  
- No full integration with airline maintenance software (e.g., AMOS, TRAX); only basic inspection data outputs provided.  

## Phase 1 (Capstone): Drone-Based Aircraft Damage Detection using Computer Vision (_6 mos_) 
**Objectives:**  
- Develop and integrate a drone-mounted imaging system capable of capturing high-resolution aircraft surface images.  
- Train and optimize computer vision models for automated detection and classification of structural damage (e.g., dents, cracks, corrosion).  
- Validate detection accuracy against manual inspection results to ensure reliability.  
- Establish a real-time data transfer pipeline between drones and ground systems for immediate assessment.

## Phase 2 (Thesis): Digital Twinâ€“Based Damage Assessment and Visualization (_1 yr_)
**Objectives:**  
- Create a digital twin model of the aircraft to map detected damages onto a 3D representation.  
- Simulate the potential structural and operational impact of identified damages within the digital twin environment.  
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for maintenance teams to visualize and prioritize detected damages.  
- Integrate predictive maintenance insights to support decision-making and reduce aircraft downtime.
